This is an attempt to find the diff between the latest English theme unit test, and Japanese theme unit test, then creating the xml for difference. Thereby creating the theme unit test posts containing new block test posts.

I have found that, basically, they are the posts dated after October 2018. So you can do `wp export --start_date=2018-10-01` to exprt the posts that are different. In numbers there are 13 posts in total: 10 blck posts, 1 keyboard navigation post, and one scheduled post for 2030. `en-theme-unit-test-post-oct-2018_2019-07-30.000.xml` file is this export as of 2019-07-30.
